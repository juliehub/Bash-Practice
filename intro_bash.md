**PROBLEM 1. Write a Bash script which accepts  as input and displays a greeting: "Welcome (name)"**

**Input Format**

One line, containing a `name`

**Output Format**

One line: "Welcome (name)" (quotation marks excluded).
The evaluation will be case-sensitive.

**Sample Input 0** `Julie`

**Sample Output 0** `Welcome Julie`


**PROBLEM 2. Use a for loop to display the natural numbers from 1 to 50**

**Input Format** There is no input

**Output Format**
```python
1
2
3
4
5
.
.
.
.
.
50
```

**PROBLEM 3.The World of Numbers**
Given two integers, `X` and `Y`, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
**Input Format**

Two lines containing one integer each (`X` and `Y` , respectively).

**Constraints**
`-100<=X,Y<=100 and Y!=0`

**Output Format**

Four lines containing the sum (`X+Y`), difference (`X-Y`), product (`X*Y`), and quotient (`X/Y`), respectively.
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)

**Sample Input**
```python
5
2
```

**Sample Output**
```python
7
3
10
2
```
**Explanation**
```python
5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2 (Integer part)
```

**PROBLEM 4: Given two integers, `X` and `Y` , identify whether `X<Y` or `X>Y` or `X=Y`.**

Exactly one of the following lines:
- X is less than Y
- X is greater than Y
- X is equal to Y

**Input Format** Two lines containing one integer each ( `X` and `Y`, respectively).

**Output Format**

Exactly one of the following lines:
- X is less than Y
- X is greater than Y
- X is equal to Y

Sample Input 1
```python
5  
2
```
Sample Input 2
```python
2
2 
```
Sample Input 3
```python
2
3  
```

Sample Output 1
`X is greater than Y `

Sample Output 2
`X is equal to Y`

Sample Output 3
`X is less than Y`
