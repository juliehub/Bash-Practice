**Output Format**

One line: "Welcome (name)" (quotation marks excluded).
The evaluation will be case-sensitive.

**Sample Input 0** `Julie`

**Sample Output 0** `Welcome Julie`


**PROBLEM 2. Use a for loop to display the natural numbers from 1 to 50**

**Input Format** There is no input

**Output Format**
```python
1
2
3
4
5
.
.
.
.
.
50
```

**PROBLEM 3.The World of Numbers**
Given two integers, `X` and `Y`, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
**Input Format**

Two lines containing one integer each (`X` and `Y` , respectively).

**Constraints**
`-100<=X,Y<=100 and Y!=0`

**Output Format**

Four lines containing the sum (`X+Y`), difference (`X-Y`), product (`X*Y`), and quotient (`X/Y`), respectively.
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)

**Sample Input**
```python
5
2
```

**Sample Output**
```python
7
3
10
2
```
**Explanation**
```python
5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2 (Integer part)
```
